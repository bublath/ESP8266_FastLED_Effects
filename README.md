# ESP8266_FastLED_Effects
FastLED Effect Webserver on ESP8266 with multiple effects and configuration options

- Provide a simply webserver to switch between effects and change parameters like effect speed, fade speed, colors, direction and more
- Most effects are modification from existing demos, but improved especially for long LED Strips (tested on 300 LED strip with 5m)
- Serial interface to define WiFi SSID/PW
- Save function to remember WiFi and Effect Settings
- Includes a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, but that can be excluded with #undef ENABLE_DHT11

Have fun
